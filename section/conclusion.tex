\section{Future work \& Conclusion}

To conclude, in this report we described and define what could be plan merging, starting by defining and formalize what are the two main part; Individual Path Finding and Plan Merging. We described for IPF various functions that could use as cost or objective functions in order to build interesting \(\tau\). Then we described different solving strategies that would take as input any \(\tau\). Multiple similar approaches and definition \cite{komenda2013repair,lichhadapeko22a} exists but do not obviously separate the two steps that I tried to define, which was my main objective.  

The whole report introduce different function, heuristics and strategies that could be implemented in order to be tested and benchmarked in future work(s). Furthermore, in the future, we would like to develop a framework which allows visualizing, test, and benchmark different IPF approaches, different \(tau\) building and merging strategies. 
In addition, due to the lack of time, multiple merging or solving strategies have not been explored such as ``guiding the agent via heatmap'', ``guiding the agent with time interval~\cite{phli11a,naphli12a}, taking into consideration robustness~\cite{atstfewabazh20a,atstfestko20a}, using highways~\cite{coko16a,courkuxuayko16a}. And finally explore the selection of strategies and heuristics given a MAPF problem instance. All of these topics are potential future addition to this report.
